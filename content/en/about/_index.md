description: 'We are three researchers based in China and trained in the fields of business strategy, economics, and public policy. We are interested in how individuals and organizations behave and interact with each other in the production, diffusion, and application of sciences and technologies; and how policy makers, at the local, national, and globle levels, can optimally intervene these behaviors and interactions. We host regular online seminars with speakers around the world to share their newest research in the broad areas of innovation and entrepreneurship. In this process, we seek to learn and to share, to promote knowledge circulation and to contribute to knowledge creation. We are open to interested participants.'
