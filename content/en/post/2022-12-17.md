**Abstract**: The objective allocation of governmental funds is central to the vitality of the scientific enterprise. In this paper, I suggest that there exists a misalignment between currently used measures to assess a labâ€™s prior publication history (e.g., journal-impact-factor weighted publication count or JIFCount) and standard practice in financial accounting (e.g., Return on Assets). To examine this disparity, I develop a novel measure I call LabROA that captures the conversion of labor inputs into scientific output, and I operationalize this measure using data from MIT Biology. As predicted by financial accounting, I demonstrate that using JIFCount introduced biases that favor larger labs. Adoption of the LabROA measure would rectify this bias, while simultaneously retaining funding for large, high-performing labs. Lastly, I calculate that use of the LabROA measure would have reallocated more than 14 percent of NIH funding within MIT Biology. Extrapolated to the current NIH budget, which stands at $37 billion, adoption of the LabROA measure to assess laboratory performance could result in a substantive readjustment of the funding landscape.
